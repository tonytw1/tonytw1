Attempting to show competence and an understanding of how computers work without resorting to white boarding exercises.


## Personal projects

### Wellynews 

[Wellynews](https://github.com/tonytw1/wellynews) aggregates community news from my home town.

Shows sensible evolution of a long-running project into separate services which can then 
develop into standalone applications in their own right.

Demonstrates a commitment to openness and Internet standards by supporting RSS views of all content.


### Squirrel Detector

[Squirrel Detector](https://github.com/tonytw1/squirrel-detector) demonstrates a willingness to tackle a new
technology (machine learning) and use pragmatic tools (python, MQTT) to realise something end to end.


## Language specific competence

### Go

[MQTT Scraper](https://github.com/tonytw1/mqtt-scraper) demonstrates a goroutine and the use of locks 
(which seem popular in the Go world) to control concurrent access to a shared resource.

Packaged as a container image to defer conversations about where it actually runs.
Google Cloud Build for infrequent builds.


### Kotlin

[NominatimAC](https://github.com/tonytw1/nominatim-ac) is an example of a Spring Boot / Kotlin application 
which has been migrated inflight from Java. The proper documentation of optional values was an important improvement over Java.

This application has ~ 100 million records in its dataset demonstrating knowledge of working with large (won't fit in memory) data streams.


### Java

Java is still an important language which is predominant in whiteboard interview settings.

General Java competence is demonstrated in these [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/tonytw1/advent2022/tree/main/src) submissions.

[This intuition](https://github.com/tonytw1/advent2022/blob/b2a345ae7c4fa36a59602d9e3a871d3ee14a4546/src/Day15.java#L45)
for [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15) part 2 was considered fairly novel by my peers.

Includes some token [stream usage](https://github.com/tonytw1/advent2022/blob/b2a345ae7c4fa36a59602d9e3a871d3ee14a4546/src/Day15.java#L87). 

### Scala

[Cards](https://github.com/tonytw1/cards) is an example of how I'd use Scala and Play Framework for a standalone service.

Scala Futures and WS Client are a good fit for the long-running async HTTP fetches this application makes.

I do not feel that Scala 3 is applicable until it's officially supported by Play Framework.
